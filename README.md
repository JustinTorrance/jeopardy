# JEOPARDY!
Jeopardy! is a three-player trivia game based on the iconic television show. The gameboard shows 4 categories with 5 questions pertaining to each category. As the dollar amount increases, so does the difficulty of the question. If your answer is correct, you win the dollar amount. Guess incorrectly, and your score decreases by the dollar amount.

To begin, press start and enter the names of the three players:

Player One begins the round by choosing a question:

If a question is the Daily Double, the player must make a wager between 5 and the player's current score. If the player's score is lower than 5, the dollar amount of the question is doubled:

Justin wagered 95 and guessed incorrectly. Now his score is only 5:
